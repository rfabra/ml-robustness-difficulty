This repository holds the code to assess robustness of ML models, i.e., their changes in behaviour when intrucing noise on their input data. Furthermore, we study the impact of intances difficulty on the behaviour of the model.

Based on this study, we group the models by similarity in terms of robustness by means of a hierarchical clustering. The models that present similar behaviour on robustness against noise and instances difficulty are grouped together.
